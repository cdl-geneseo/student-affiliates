# Journal Entries

CDL Affiliates will post journal entries to the `cdl-geneseo/student-affiliates` repository at least once a week.  

## Weekly Entries

### Format

You should keep your journal as `.md` files and use markdown to write them. Need a refresher? Check out commonmark.org's [reference page](https://commonmark.org/help/).

A word about length: write as much as you need to say what you want to say. That being said, if you have less than a full paragraph, you might want to ask yourself what you might be leaving out. Furthermore, if your post is approaching more than 2 or 3 scrolls to get through, you might want to make it a 2-part-er. 

### Content

These entries should be informal, but well-written (they'll be public, after all!). Each entry should be reflective in nature, and can be about something you learned that week, how you see digital learning/tools/humanities operating in the world around you (in your classes or current events, etc.), or on a specific subject, such as detailing a new tool.

### Posting

1. Create a MD file and name each file according to a `year-day-month_name` structure. You can either do this manually each time, or use the `journal.sh` action you learned in ENG340. If you use the script, you'll want to think about how you'll need to adjust the commands to align with this workflow as opposed to the ENG340 workflow.
1. Push to your individual folder.

## Blog Posts

These are the posts that you'll write for the CDL blog, one in the middle of the semester and one at the end. Since you don't have full collaborator access to this repository, you'll have to follow a different workflow than the one you follow for your weekly journal entries.  

### Format

The format for these posts is largely the same as for your weekly journals.

As far as length is concerned, however, while you'll want your post to be substantial (this speaks more to the quality of and your interest in the topic you chose to write about than anything else) don't feel pressured to write a novel. Again, write as much as you need to say what you want to say.

### Content

The content of your posts, similar to your weekly journal entries, should be reflective, but, other than that, can be about whatever you're interested in related to digital studies and learning!

### Posting

1. First and foremost, fork the `cdl-geneseo.github.io` repository to your own GitHub account.
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
1. Write your journals in `.md` files locally in the `_drafts` folder.
1. Open a pull request when you're ready to have your draft reviewed.
1. Communicate with Paul/Amanda in GitHub to move the draft to acceptance.
