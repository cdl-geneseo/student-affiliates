# Journal Entries

CDL Affiliates will post journal entries to the `cdl-geneseo/student-affiliates` repository at least once a week.  

## Format

You should keep your journal as `.md` files and use markdown to write them. Need a refresher? Check out commonmark.org's [reference page](https://commonmark.org/help/).

A word about length: write as much as you need to say what you want to say. That being said, if you have less than a full paragraph, you might want to ask yourself what you might be leaving out. Furthermore, if your post is approaching more than 2 or 3 scrolls to get through, you might want to make it a 2-part-er. 

## Content

These entries should be informal, but well-written (they'll be public, after all!). Each entry should be reflective in nature, and can be about something you learned that week, how you see digital learning/tools/humanities operating in the world around you (in your classes or current events, etc.), or on a specific subject, such as detailing a new tool.

## Posting

You should follow this workflow when working on and posting your journal entries:
