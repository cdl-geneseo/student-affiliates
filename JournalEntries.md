# Journal Entries

CDL Affiliates will post journal entries to the `cdl-geneseo/student-affiliates` repository at least once a week.  

## Weekly Entries

### Format

You should keep your journal as `.md` files and use markdown to write them. Need a refresher? Check out commonmark.org's [reference page](https://commonmark.org/help/).

A word about length: write as much as you need to say what you want to say. That being said, if you have less than a full paragraph, you might want to ask yourself what you might be leaving out. Furthermore, if your post is approaching more than 2 or 3 scrolls to get through, you might want to make it a 2-part-er. 

### Content

These entries should be informal, but well-written (they'll be public, after all!). Each entry should be reflective in nature, and can be about something you learned that week, how you see digital learning/tools/humanities operating in the world around you (in your classes or current events, etc.), or on a specific subject, such as detailing a new tool.

### Posting

1. Create a MD file and name each file according to a `year-day-month_name` structure. You can either do this manually each time, or use the `journal.sh` action you learned in ENG340. If you use the script, you'll want to think about how you'll need to adjust the commands to align with this workflow as opposed to the ENG340 workflow.
1. Push to your individual folder.
