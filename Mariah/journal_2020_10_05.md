## HTML Review 

- Basic template

< !DOCTYPE html >
<html lang="en">

    <head>
        ...
    </head>

    <body>
        ...
    </body>

< /html >

- DOCTYPE is important - it tells the computer how to read the code 

- The root element determines the language 

- Whatever is between the < html > and < /html > tags will be read as HTML.

- Whatever is between the < head > and < /head > tags will be read as the "title, keywords, authors, a short description, and so on," this is also where the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) will go. 

- Whatever is between the < body > and < /body > tags will include things like paragraphs and images aka the body of your website.

- The < h1 >, < h2 >, < h3 >, etc. tags denote headings and subheadings, with < h1 > being the largest and < h6 > the smallest.

- The < a > tag, or anchor tag, creates a link to another document - can be on the same website, or an external site

    - **Relative links** take the current page as an origin point and search for other files within the same folder or directory. This method is useful for creating links to pages within your own site (like when sites have tabs)

    - **Absolute links** include information that allows the browser to find resources on other websites (linking to external sites) 

- You can also provide links to images on your computer using < img src="image title" alt="image description" />
