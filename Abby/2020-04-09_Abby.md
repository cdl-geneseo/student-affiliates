# Week One

## And so it begins!

This week was my first official week as a Student Affiliate for the Center of Digital Learning. It was really nice getting to know everyone a bit better through our Zoom meetings. 

We talked about some of the goals we would like to achieve in the future, one of the biggest ones being the CDL becoming a welcoming space for Geneseo students and staff alike. Obviously, this is much easier said than done with the COVID-19 pandemic going on. One of the ideas brought up was hosting public Zoom events, where individuals could come together and share interests, whether it be open-mics, musical group performances, etc. I am interested in seeing if we can actually pull this off one day!

We also went through a refresher of pushing files to GitHub, so here are the terminal commands needed for future reference.

*Before creating a new file or updating a shared one, make sure to use 'git pull' to sync everything first!*

1) git status
2) git add (name of file)
3) git status
4) git commit -m "note about file"
5) git push

And you're done!
