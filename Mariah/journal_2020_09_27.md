# What I Learned Today 

## Work with the Black Student Union 

 - As one of the Public Relations Coordinators on the Black Student Union executive board, I (along with the other PR) am in charge of making flyers for our events and keeping our members updated via social media. 
 
 - This week, we had to collaborate and create a poster for our S'mores / Bonfire Night with CSA and ASA. The other PR had thrown around some ideas and suggested that her goals were unattainable. 

 - As the technology lover I am, I took it upon myself (at 4AM) to abandon the club approved 
 [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). Instead, I used an application on my computer called [Photo Image Editor - Pixel Style](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photo-image-editor-pixelstyle/id1244649277?mt=12). 

 - With Photo Image Editor, which I will now refer to as PIE, the user is able to edit pictures way beyond the average basic photo editing app. With my limited graphic design experience, I was able to mock up some flyers that encompassed both PRs' visions.

 - Below, you will find some of my first drafts for the flyer. My fellow PR had wanted the clubs' names in a 'fire font,' with people sitting around a fire and had sent a picture of a bonfire. While I could not get the people sitting around the fire, I knew what components I wanted use. 
    - Her picture of a bonfire
    - The fire font 
    - An ooey-gooey s'mores picture

*Fig. 2: An alternative if the fire font was too aggressive, I chose to try other s'mores and bonfire photos as well*

- In order to make these mock ups a reality, I had to download fonts and make the backgrounds of my JPG files transparent. In PIE, I had to make a custom gradient for each and every title seen on the flyer to make sure it looked uniform, but like I was not *trying* to make it look uniform. Overall, I think that I have learned a lot more about PIE as well as pairing fonts together. Everyone I showed could barely tell the differences in all of my drafts (made about 6), but I could 1000% tell when the fonts looked ugly next to each other. 

- This was very fun for me and I felt very tech-y doing it. Below you will find the final version of the flyer and I hope you enjoy! :')
