# Center for Digital Learning Internship Overview & Timeline

## Overview

Student Affiliates help the center to advance the work and sustain the values of the 
[CDL](https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl):

- **Openness:** The methods and fruits of digital learning should be widely shared.
- **Collaboration:** Geneseo’s work in digital environments should draw on and promote the strength of our community.
- **Student-centered pedagogy:** The design and execution of digitally-enabled instruction should reflect how students learn.
- **Inclusivity:** The design and execution of digitally-enabled instruction should reflect the college’s commitment to diversity and equitable access.
- **Agency:** Technology should serve, inform, and sometimes transform — but never dictate — how we teach and learn.
- **Transparency:** Our community should be able to know what our tools for digital learning know about them, and how that knowledge is used.
- **Creativity:** Digital tools should be a means to explore and experiment with new approaches to teaching, learning, knowledge-creation, and artistic expression.
