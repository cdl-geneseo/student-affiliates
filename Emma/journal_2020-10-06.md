## HTML Refresher
---
I decided to push my journal post about LMSs off to next week, and make note of some new things I learned about HTML this week. 

1. The attributes "width=" and "height=" adjust the size of an image. "style=" adjusts the alignment of an image. Additionally, although the <img> element is open, you can still cap the line with >. 
2. Closed element < br > adds a linebreak in the middle of a paragraph.
3. Closed element < pre > preserves all existing spaces and linebreaks. 
4. Closed element < strong > **bolds** text, < em > *italicizes* text. 
5. Closed element < mark > highlights text, < del > strikes through text. 
6. Closed element < q > puts text in quotation marks. Especially useful as quotation marks are used elsewhere in HTML, ex. encasing an image URL. Without the <q> element, it would be hard to differentiate between utilitarian quotation marks and text that is meant to be shown in a quote. 
7. Closed element < ul > generates an unordered list, < ol > generates an ordered list, both using the element < li > for list content
8. Make an image into a link!!! (unnecessary spaces added here and throughout so this would show up in .md)
    - < a href = "URL of link page" >
      < img src = "your image" > </a >

Side note: the W3Schools page was very informative, and a handy reference to keep around: https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
