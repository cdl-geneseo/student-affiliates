# Digital Tools Refamiliarization
Use these resources to refresh your knowledge on these key digital tools. If it takes a little while for things to make sense again, don't worry! These skills take consistent practice to retain; it's truly a use-it-or-lose-it situation. We suggest that while you're going through these resources, you think about how you might be able to utilize these skills in your own scholarship!
